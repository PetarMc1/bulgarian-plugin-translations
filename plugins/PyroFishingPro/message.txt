Additions:
- Added new particle effects to the Acidrain storm type.
- Added the ability to customise the base plugin command.
- Added every single message to the messages.yml - some commands were previously untranslatable.
- Added per-config storm settings. (Looks a lot cleaner and easier to find things).
- Added some missing per-storm configuration to each storm.
- Added the ability for some config sections in the storm files to be removed and for them to use default settings if you want cleaner files.
- Added ‘blocked-regions’, ‘blocked-worlds’, ‘blocked-biomes’ to every storm type.
- Added loads more configuration to the StormStarter - which allows for more flexibility.
- Added the capability to set some values in ticks, rather than seconds for more flexibility and customisation. (i.e. damage, potion effects, etc)
- Added the ‘status’ alias to the ‘info’ command.
- Added full configuration options to every storm. Nothing is hard-coded internally now, and you can fully configure the storms to your liking.
- Added a new ‘*<name>’ option to blocked-biomes for all storms that allow you to allow-list biomes that contain that name, or match exact.
- Added Line of Sight option to Lightning Storms to help with players getting hit in houses, or behind cover.

General Changes:
- Reformatted the info command to look cleaner and use proper timing conventions instead of just seconds.
- Changed ‘EnabledWorlds’ into ‘disabled-worlds’ instead to make configuration easier. This will affect the automatic storm-starter and command activation.
- Removed all per-storm settings from the config.yml.
- Updated to PyroLib v1.3.0 as a minimum requirement.
- Fully recoded the entire core to function more efficiently, and allow for further upgrades in the future.
- Cleaned up and organised configuration sections for each storm to be more easily readable to owners.
- Changed the plugin startup console logs.
- Changed the Lightning Storm strikes to be silent, but have additional sounds that can be modified to your liking.
- Changed Lightning Storms to strike in a random pattern instead of all at once, to make it seem more consistent and not predictable.
- Updated the Blizzard particles & effects.
- Realigned permissions for the plugin, and added per-command permission nodes.
- Removed some un-used placeholders.
- Removed /pw stopall but merged it into the normal /pw stop command.
- Changed timers to use a proper format, hh,mm,ss, instead of only seconds.
- [Optimisation] Vastly optimised the internal tickers and storm starters.
- [Optimisation] Vastly optimised the storm particles and effects across the board.
- [Optimisation] Optimised the Lightning Strike storm entirely.
